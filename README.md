# üõ†Ô∏è Floating Trash Collector Bot (Arduino-Based)

This project is a **solar-powered river cleaning robot** designed to detect and collect floating waste from water bodies using ultrasonic sensors, servos, and a dual-motor system. It supports both **manual** and **autonomous** modes and aims to reduce human effort in cleaning polluted rivers and lakes.
